      <h2>Review</h2>
      <p id="movie-review">
        Director Prasanth Varma, who shot to fame with films like Awe and Zombie Reddy, has once again teamed up with young actor Teja Sajja to bring us HanuMan, a Telugu-language superhero film, as part of the Prasanth Varma Cinematic Universe. The Sankranti release, also starring Amritha Aiyer, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, and Vinay Rai, intricately weaves together elements of Indian mythology with a contemporary narrative. The film presents a classic confrontation between two central characters: Hanumanthu, the deserving bearer of divine power, and Michael, the antagonist driven by his desperate pursuit of the same supernatural abilities. Prasanth skilfully integrates familiar elements from various sources, blending them with CGI, thereby enhancing the protagonist's supernatural presence in the village setting. The story also delves into the rural dynamics and struggles of Anjanadri, including a love story and the challenges faced by villagers under oppressive practices.
Teja Sajja portrays his character of Hanumanthu, aka HanuMan, with great conviction, initially as a mischievous thief and later as someone who carries the mantle of playing the saviour of Anjanadri. The success of this film will surely propel him into a different league. Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, as Anjamma, the elder sister of Hanumanthu, packs a punch with her performance. She is a blend of beauty and power. Amritha Aiyer brings a sense of balance to the mix as Meenakshi, a doctor and daughter of a school teacher. The love angle between Hanumanthu and Meenakshi becomes an integral part of the plot.</p><p>Vinay Rai, playing the antagonist, looks his part (typical supervillain) and strongly contributes to the adventurous plot. All of them brought depth and authenticity to the characters they portrayed. Other notable members of the cast include Vennela Kishore, Samuthirakani, Getup Srinu, Satya, and Raj Deepak Shetty.
The visual effects (VFX) of the film deserve special mention for enhancing the narrative without overwhelming it, creating a visually engaging experience for the audience. The cinematography by Dasaradhi Sivendra and editing by Sai Babu Talari contribute significantly to the film's appeal. The music by Anudeep Dev, Gowra Hari, and Krishna Saurabh adds to the overall experience. If there's something that could have been better, itâ€™s the pacing, especially in the first half. A tighter edit and shorter runtime might have improved the viewing experience even further.
With solid storytelling, impressive visuals, and strong performances, the film successfully merges elements of mythology with contemporary action, offering a unique viewing experience in Indian cinema.
