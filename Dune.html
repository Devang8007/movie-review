        <strong> Story: </strong> Story: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) joins forces with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen, seeking vengeance against those who tore his family apart. He must choose between his love and duty to avert a catastrophic future only he can foresee.
</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> Sequels often get a bad rap for being poor follow-ups of the original volume. And if it’s one of the most-awaited movies like Dune 2, the expectations and anticipation are that much higher. But Denis Villeneuve’s outing goes beyond all expectations! This is one of those rare movies that gets it bang on in every aspect – story, narrative, production, treatment, visuals, performances, and music.
Based on Frank Herbert’s book series, the sequel of Dune: One (2021) is monumental and pitch-perfect. Of course, the stunning CGI and VFX will gobsmack you, but all the other nuances are just as incredibly mounted. The story and narrative depth make the sci-fi movie engaging from the first frame to the last. The vast desert landscapes on the fictional planet Arrakis will astound you, and the credit goes to cinematographer Greig Fraser.
The new outing also introduces new characters, and you get to delve deeper into the different tribes’ cultures and backstories. While characterisations are outstanding, from the noble Fremen leader, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the bone-chilling sociopathic Fyed-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), or the evil Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Baron (Stellan Skarsgård). Lady Jessica Artreides (Rebecca Ferguson) and Paul’s character arcs deserve special mention. While the former turns into a shrewd Bene Gesserit Reverend-Mother, Paul comes of age and makes some hard decisions. The on-screen mother-son duo pulls off their respective arcs splendidly. Zendaya, as Chani, is brilliant and has great chemistry with Timothée Chalamet. The relationship is bittersweet, and the actors play their parts perfectly.
The world that’s been created, and its mysteries, will leave you wanting to delve deeper. The dystopian desert planet with the most valuable mineral, Spice, has cubic tonnes of holy water that the religious folk would rather die than drink. But they don’t flinch from sucking water out of dead bodies’ systems. All this is perfectly elevated by Hans Zimmer’s music and background score. Not a minute in its 2 hours 46 minutes runtime drags or gets overwhelming.
Dune 2 is more monumental than its predecessor, and if you’re a fan waiting for this big-screen behemoth, head to a theatre pronto. If you’re yet to be introduced to this world, catch Part One for references and the context. You will appreciate the Part Two better. After all, it’s not just a movie to be watched but experienced!
